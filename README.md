# cafeteriasystem
I designed and developed a comprehensive cafeteria system using Angular, Java Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. The system incorporates robust security measures, including Spring Security and JWT tokens to safeguard user interactions. This system provides an array of functionalities, enabling users to seamlessly log in, register, access the daily menu, make purchases, and review transaction histories. For administrators, the system offers the capability to update the menu, manage user properties, and access comprehensive transaction histories and daily profit reports for all users.
